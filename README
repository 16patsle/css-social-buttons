CSS SOCIAL BUTTONS
@smcllns

How to use these buttons:
1/ You only need social_buttons.css and social_buttons_icons.png. Place them in the same directory together.
2/ The markup is really straightforward, for example:

<button class="social_buttons sb_24 sb_facebook"><span>Button text here</span></button>

OR

<a class="social_buttons sb_48 sb_facebook"><span>Button text here</span></a>

3/ You can use any parent element you like (button, p, a, whatever), just remember the nested span (and this must be a span element).
4/ Include the class .social_buttons
5/ Specify the small or large size of button by including either .sb_24 or .sb_48
6/ Specify the type of button by including either .sb_facebook, .sb_linkedin, .sb_twitter or .sb_google
7/ Include whatever button text you like
8/ Any additional styles you need should be applied to the .social_buttons class for example:

#my_landing_page .social_buttons {
	clear: both;
	float: left;
	width: 200px
}

9/ Done! Happy days.
