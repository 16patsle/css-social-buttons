# Zocial CSS social buttons

I basically rewrote this entire set so they are full vector buttons, meaning:

- @font-face icons
- custom font file for all social icons
- em sizing based on button font-size
- support for about 44 different services
- buttons and icons supported
- no raster images (sweet)
- works splendidly on any browser supporting @font-face
- CSS3 degrades gracefully in <IE8 etc.

## How to use these buttons:
